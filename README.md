# metal-sample
This is just a simple reference project for how to use Metal. All it does is create a Cube and place it in the middle of the scene while 
simultanneously rendering the camera image from the back camera. 

Notes 
====
* Uses ARKit to obtain the camera image 
* Shows how to construct a cube manually 
* Also shows how to render multiple items simultaneously. 
* Note that there are some wrapper classes to make it simpler to remember how to use buffers for instance. 
* Also note that none of this code should be considered best practice, this is just me messing around.
